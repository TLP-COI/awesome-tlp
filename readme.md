## What is TLP?  

- 📃 [Technical Language Processing: Unlocking Maintenance Knowledge](https://www.nist.gov/publications/technical-language-processing-unlocking-maintenance-knowledge) - Paper that describes the TLP concept and provides a call to action for the community. 
- 📃 [NLP Workshop Report](https://www.nist.gov/publications/summary-report-standards-requirements-gathering-workshop-natural-language-analysis) - Workshop report on current trends, successes, and challenges with respect to NLP for maintenance in manufacturing.
- 📃 [NLP Standards Needs Report](https://www.nist.gov/publications/standards-needs-maintenance-work-order-analysis-manufacturing) - Discussion on standards needs for NLP in maintenance.

## TLP Support Tools

- 🖥️ [Nestor GUI](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nestor) - Nestor Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a free toolkit that helps maintainers annotate their Maintenance Work Order (MWO) data through a process called "tagging".
- 🖥️ [Redcoat](https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/redcoat) - A web-based annotation tool that supports collaborative hierarchical entity typing. 


## TLP Datasets

- 🗄️ [Excavator Maintenance Dataset](https://prognosticsdl.ecm.uwa.edu.au/pdl/) - The Excavators Raw&Cleaned dataset provides annotated MWOs.
- 🗄️ [NYC Maintenance Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Asset-Management-Parks-System-AMPS-Work-Orders/8sdw-8vja) - This dataset provides raw MWOs for park equipment. 


## TLP Resources
